    "We can implement the above in various ways the method ive used is known as modified nodal analysis or MNA in short. In MNA every component has a stamp on the matrix, For example a resistor between two nodes 1 and 2 will have a stamp of (1/R) for matrix entries (1,1) and (2,2) and (-1/R) for entries (1,2) and (2,1). This is equivalent to writing the nodal equations for n1 and n2 and using them to form the matrix, we are just using the pattern each component forms in the matrix instead so that our work is easier. Similarly other components have different stamp values and hence we can form our matrices A and b to solve the equation Ax=b. Inorder to do that we pass the matrices A and b as argument to our gaussian elimination solver which we defined earlier. The answer will give us the nodal voltages and current through any independent voltage source. "
